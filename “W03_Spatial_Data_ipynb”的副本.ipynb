By the end of the year, 9,917 fires had burned more than 4% of the state's area, making 2020 the largest wildfire season recorded in California's modern history. California's August Complex fire has been described as the first \"gigafire\", burning over 1 million acres across seven counties, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. The fires destroyed over 10,000 structures and cost over \\$12.079 billion (2020 USD) in damages, including over \\$10 billion in property damage and \\$2.079 billion in fire suppression costs. The intensity of the fire season has been attributed to a combination of more than a century of poor forest management and higher temperatures resulting from climate change.\n",

When we think of wildfires, we think of short-term events — and hopefully they are — but they can have long-term consequences considering your overall air pollution exposure.”\n",

A few kilometers downwind of the fires, the AQI sensors display very high readings. Remember, our AQI data and the satellite imagery are derived from totally different sources, and are totally different types of data, but they seem to be telling us the same story. They actually complement each other in important ways. In our original plot of the AQI sensors without satellite imagery, we could tell that there was bad air quality on September 9th, but some sensors were green and others were red. The satellite image shows us that the variation in AQI across California on September 9th was due to the direction of the wind, blowing the smoke from the wildfires westward."
